## Description
This weather tracker allows a user to: 
- check the current weather of a city by inputing the city's name in the search bar 
- Once searched, the user is presented with the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index
- The UV index is also color coded: 
    - Green: UV radiaition is favorable and it is okay to go outside with minimal sun protection.
    - Yellow: UV radition has become a bit worse, sun screen is advised.
    - Orange: UV radiation is bad, sun screen and clothing that covers arms and legs are advised.
    - Red: UV radiation is extrmely dangerous to exposed skin, use suns screen liberlly and wear clothing that covers most of your body and attempt to seek shade.
- Additionally, the user is also presented with a 5-day forecast row that displays the weather for the coming five days
- Search history is saved onto the page so you can click on the city rather than retype a city's name.
